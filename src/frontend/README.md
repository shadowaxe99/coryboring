# Sports Agent Assistant: The David and Goliath Edition

Welcome to the world of sports management, where the stakes are high, the players are like Goliaths, and you, the sports agent, are like David. But fear not! With our Sports Agent Assistant, you're not just a shepherd boy in a field; you're a shepherd boy with a high-tech, AI-powered slingshot.

## Python Scripts: Your Five Smooth Stones

Just as David picked up five smooth stones before his battle with Goliath, we've equipped you with five Python scripts to help you conquer your Goliaths. You'll find these in the 'src' directory:

- player_analysis.py: This is your 'accuracy stone'. It helps you hit the mark every time with functions for preprocessing player data, training a machine learning model on the data, and evaluating the model.

- contract_analysis.py: This is your 'negotiation stone'. It helps you strike a fair deal with functions for assessing the market value of a player, analyzing salary cap implications, and negotiating contracts for players.

- player_report.py: This is your 'knowledge stone'. It helps you know your player inside and out, with a function for generating a player report that includes player performance metrics, potential assessment, value estimation, and recommendations for agents.

- marketing_strategy.py: This is your 'strategy stone'. It helps you plan your next move with a function for generating player marketing strategies using the GPT-3.5 model.

- marketing_endorsements.py: This is your 'popularity stone'. It helps you win the crowd with a function for tracking player marketing and endorsements. It generates player marketing strategies and identifies endorsement opportunities using the GPT-3.5 model.

- player_tracking.py: This is your 'watchful stone'. It helps you keep an eye on the game with functions for retrieving real-time game data, extracting player statistics from the game data, and updating the player's performance metrics in the database.

## Getting Started: Slinging Your First Stone

To start your David vs. Goliath journey, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You also need to install the required Python libraries which are listed in the 'requirements.txt' file. You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the requirements, you can run each Python script individually. For example, to run the player_analysis.py script, use the following command:

```bash
python player_analysis.py
```
